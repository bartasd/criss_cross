# CRISS-CROSS

This project was created to learn some basic REACT functionality and to have some fun :satisfied:

## Upgrades needed

- Need to upgrade computer logic - from random placing to more logical.
- Need to fix responsive design.
- Need to make some login form, and round-score counters.
- Need to outsource code to other files to make code more readable.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
